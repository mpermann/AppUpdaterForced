# The script is for patching an app with user notification before starting, if the app is running. If the app
# is not running, it will be silently patched without any notification to the user. Parameter 4 is the name
# of the app to patch. Parameter 5 is the name of the app process. Parameter 6 is the policy trigger name
# for the policy installing the app. This is a forced update that does not allow deferral, but requires user
# consent to start the patching. The script is relatively basic and can't currently kill more than one process
# or patch more than one app.
